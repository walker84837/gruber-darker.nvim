This is a port of [rexim's
extension](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme) of the Gruber Darker
theme.

## Known Bugs

  - Choosing a different theme or none at all, before choosing this theme will
    lead to unexpected background colors. For now, to get the closest results, I
    recommend to first switch to `habamax`, and then switch to `gruber_darker`

  - Not all colors match with the original theme, with the solution I described
    in the last point. An example of this is the titles.
